## Introduction

> _Modern user interfaces are assembled from hundreds of modular UI components 
> that are rearranged to deliver different user experiences.  
> Design systems contain reusable UI components that help teams build complex, 
> durable, and accessible user interfaces across projects. Since both designers 
> and developers contribute to the UI components, the design system serves as a
> bridge between disciplines. It is also the “source of truth” for an
> organization’s common components._ - [Design Systems for Developers: Introduction][1]

Flexbook is a template project for building production ready design systems with
[Storybook][2]. For more information about building production design systems,
visit [Design Systems for Developers][3] from the [Learn Storybook][4] docs.

## Architecture

Following the [Atomic Design Methodology][1], this starter has a heavy focus on
organization and documentation. The goal is to build a well organized,
appropriately documented component library that makes implementing,
testing, documenting, and maintaining production-grade UI components more
efficient.

## Usage

Flexbook components are developed in [React][1]; their stories and
documentation are written in [MDX][2] using [Storybook Docs][3]. 

The starter documentation can be [viewed here][4].

### Installation

Once published, you'll be able to install your components. Before installing the
components, you'll need to install React. Visit [Getting Started][1] from the
React docs to learn more about installing React in your project.

After you've installed React, run the following command:

```bash
  npm i @<PACKAGE_OWNER>/<PACKAGE_NAME>@latest
```

being sure to replace `PACKAGE_OWNER` and `PACKAGE_NAME` with the appropriate
values.

### Sass

This starter comes ready to use [Sass][1].

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to use use variables, nested rules,
mixins, functions within your stylesheets, making it easy to share styles across
your project, as well as organize projects of all sizes.

The global styles were loaded using the configuration below, found in `main.js`:

```javascript
{
  /**
   * Alters the Storybook Webpack configuration.
   *
   * @param param1.configType has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'.
   * 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.
   *
   * @param {object} config - Base Webpack config
   * @param {object} param1 - Storybook config
   * @param {string} param1.configType - Storybook development environment
   * @returns {object} Webpack configuration
   */
  webpackFinal: async (config, { configType }) => {
    config.module.rules.push(
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          { loader: 'style-loader' },
          { loader: 'css-loader' },
          {
            loader: 'sass-loader',
            options: {
              data: '@import ../../../sass/global.sass',
              sassOptions: {
                includePaths: ['./src/components/**/**/*.sass'],
                indentedSyntax: true,
                prependData: `$env: ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    )

    return config
  }
}
```
